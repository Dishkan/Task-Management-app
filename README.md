For absolute beginners in laravel who want to learn it and make a first project.
I improved Taylor Otwell's task list laravel app:)

#setup
To setup the project, you need to open tasks.sql file within the laravel project and import it to
Mysql database and then it will work.

#usage
In this app you can add tasks, delete and edit it. Additionally you can change order of tasks with drag and drop function and after that it will show you priority of tasks by changing their id on the screen
